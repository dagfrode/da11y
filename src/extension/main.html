    <p>
      We reccomend that you set up linting and playwright tests as part of your
      developer enviroment and pipelines.
    </p>

    <h2>Automated test</h2>
    <p>
      Before continuing testing. We reccomend you run a tool like Wave or
      SiteImprove. They are both good free extensions that help you catch quite
      a few code detectable problems.
    </p>

    <h2>Manual tests</h2>

    <p>
      You have now tested what can be automated. It is now time to roll up your
      sleves and get started. We will guide you trough a few subject trying to
      cover what has to be tested manually as well as possible.
